# Job Portal Overview

A job portal is a web application designed to streamline the job application process, connecting job seekers with employers. It provides a centralized platform for job seekers to search for jobs, create profiles, upload resumes, and apply for positions, while also allowing recruiters to post jobs, manage applications, and connect with potential candidates.

## Key Features

*   User Registration and Profiles: Allows job seekers to create accounts with essential details, upload resumes, and detail their work experience, skills, and career goals.
*   Job Listings: A central repository of job openings with job titles, descriptions, qualifications, salary range, company details, and application deadlines. Jobs are categorized by industry, job type, and location.
*   Search and Filters: Enables users to search for jobs using keywords and advanced filters such as location, salary range, job type, and experience level.
*   Job Application: Allows users to apply for jobs directly through the portal by submitting resumes and cover letters. Some portals offer structured application forms and one-click apply options.
*   Recruiter Panel: Enables recruiters to track candidates, manage applications, schedule interviews, communicate with candidates, and generate data insights and reports.

## Tech Stack

The tech stack for building a job portal typically includes:

| Category              | Technologies                         | Details                                                                    |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Frontend              | React.js, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS | For building the user interface and handling client-side logic.            |
| Backend               | Node.js, Express.js, Python, Laravel, C# | For server-side logic, API development, and handling requests.          |
| Real-time Communication | Socket.io                            | Enables real-time features like live chat and instant notifications.        |
| Database              | MongoDB                              | For storing job listings, user profiles, and application data.             |
| Mobile Development    | Java, Kotlin (Android), Swift, Objective-C (iOS) | For developing native mobile applications (if applicable).             |
| UI Libraries (Mobile) | Android UI, Jetpack Compose, UIKit, SwiftUI | For creating user interface elements in mobile apps.                     |
| Development Tools (Mobile) | Android Studio, Xcode, AppCode       | IDE for mobile app development.                                          |

A MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) is often used for job portal development. This stack allows for a seamless experience for both job seekers and employers.
